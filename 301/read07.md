Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.

 He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.


Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

> Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
HTTP is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It’s the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

What does a GET do?

when you’re using a web browser because browsers pretty much just GET stuff. They don’t do a lot of other types of interaction with resources. This is a problem because it has led many people to assume that HTTP is just for GET’ing. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

What does a POST do?
If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

What does PUT do?
if a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.


What does PATCH do?
to do a partial update, it’ll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.
