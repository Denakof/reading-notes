## Why is access control important?
Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.

## Describe an application that would need access control.
Access control is a method of guaranteeing that users are who they say they are and that they have the appropriate access to company data.

At a high level, access control is a selective restriction of access to data. It consists of two main components: authentication and authorization, says Daniel Crowley, head of research for IBMâ€™s X-Force Red, which focuses on data security.


## What is a role used for?

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
... Unifying security controls across infrastructure and applications can improve the consistency of security policies while enhancing visibility into and accountability for security. ABAC extends traditional identity and access management providing a flexible, efficient way to define granular access policies [4]. Using a high level security policy language implementing ABAC, it is possible to describe granular security controls, which can include control flow logic, handle events, and introspect internal and external state in order to make security policy decisions. ...
... RBAC is inefficient for granular controls and does not account for contextual information, events external to the policy system, or the current state of external systems. In the worst case, an ABAC policy system could require up to 2 n rules for n attributes while an RBAC system could require 2 n roles [4]. RBAC systems do not provide general purpose conditional logic and cannot distinguish within the scope of permitted access if particular actions are benign or malicious. ...


- Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a resource. Of course, this definition may sound obscure, but many situations in real life can help illustrate what authorization means so that you can apply those concepts to computer systems. A good example is house ownership.

- A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object.
