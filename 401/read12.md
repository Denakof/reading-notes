What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

TDM-based networks must transform into packet-based networks to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services. Packet-based networks not only enable new innovations, services, and business opportunities, they are also the most cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks for content delivery/

UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt. Examples of applications that use connectionless transport services are broadcasting and tftp .


Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.٢٨‏/١١‏/٢٠١٤


Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

A connected socket is assigned to a new (dedicated) port, so it means that the number of concurrent connections is limited by the number of ports, unless multiple sockets can share the same port

Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.

Observer Pattern:The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.


Event Handler:Events are signals fired inside the browser window that notify of changes in the browser or operating system environment. Programmers can create event handler code that will run when an event fires, allowing web pages to respond appropriately to change

Event Driven Programming:In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads.

Event Loop: In computer science, the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. ... When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does, it may be termed the main loop or main event loop.

Event Queue:An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.

Call Stack:A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function,

database
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. ... The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.
