- What are the advantages of TDD approach?
Better program design and higher code quality. ...
Detailed project documentation. ...
TDD reduces the time required for project development. ...
Code flexibility and easier maintenance. ...

- What is one downside of Test Driven Development
probably, the strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. ... this suggests that you simply got to change the tests first then make the tests pass. So, actually, this disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.

beforeEach(fn, timeout)

Runs a function before each of the tests in this file runs. If the function returns a promise or is a generator, Jest waits for that promise to resolve before running the test. Optionally, you can provide a timeout (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.

ES5 function constructors
This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated.

ES6 class constructors
This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator.

Why REST?
REST aims to make caching easier. Since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually, GET requests should usually return the same response regardless of previous ones and the session. This makes the GET requests easily cacheable and browsers usually treat them as such.

functional programming:
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. ... When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.

object-oriented programming (OOP):
Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods. Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another.

Classes
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

super:
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

this:
A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

Test Driven Development (TDD):
In layman's terms, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases before developing the actual code. It is an iterative approach that combines programming, the creation of unit tests, and refactoring.

jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

CI:
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.

REST:
A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.


Data model:
A data model organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. Since data elements document real life people, places and things and the events between them, the data model represents reality. ... They are used to show the data needed and created by business processes .
