# Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

## Building Blocks

### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a **block-level** box or an **inline** box

- Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

- Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img> <b> <i>`

#### Controll ing the Position of Elements

- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning
- Fixed Positioning
- Floating Elements

- screen sizes

### A Fixed Width Layout

- To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels (and sometimes their height, too).

#### Layout Grids

- Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers

- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page
