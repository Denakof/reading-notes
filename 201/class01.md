## HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages
 
 #### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages.

 ##### Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

* HTML p XX ages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
- A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.
- nav
- article 
- aside
- sections
- figure 
- div


## summary
- the new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google
