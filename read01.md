### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.


### It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# Syntax guide
**-Headers** _this hashtag *#* is like the h1 tag_

**-emphasis** _this text will be *bold*_

**-image** 
**-links**

## Automatic linking for URLs
###### Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.


## Strikethrough
###### Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
