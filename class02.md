## HTML has six "levels" of headings:<h1> is used for main headings <h2> is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...

### To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

### By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.

### By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

### The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.

### The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.
