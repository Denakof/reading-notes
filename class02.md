## HTML has six "levels" of headings:<h1> is used for main headings <h2> is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...

### To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

### By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.

### By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

### The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.

### The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.

- CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how thatelement should look.
 - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
