# **How to use HTML**


### Comments in HTML :
###### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
**<!-- comment goes here -->**


### Inline Elements :

###### Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as *inline elements*.

### Grouping Text & Elements In a Block :
##### <div> 
###### The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

### IFrames : 
*<iframe>*

###### one common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).

### New Html5 Layout Elements (ch17)

###### For example, the header sits inside a new <header> element, the navigation in a <nav>element, and the articles are in individual <article> elements.

***Headers & Footers***

<header> <footer>

#### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
+ The main header or footer 
that appears at the top or 
bottom of every page on the 
site.

+  A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

***Navigation***
<nav>
#### The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

### WireFrames: 
###### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
