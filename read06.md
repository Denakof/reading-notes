# Javascript
#### A script is a series of instructions that acomputer can follow to achieve a goal. 

### An example of a flowchart:

+ A script is a series of instructions that the computercan follow in order to achieve a goal.

+ Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
+ Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans,so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
+ To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

## EXPRESSIONS:
#### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 

+ EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
###### In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).
### var color = 'beige';
###### **The value of color is now beige.**

+ EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 
###### You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value.
#### For example:
### var area = 3 * 2;
###### **The value of area is now 6.**

### OPERATORS 
##### Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers tocreate a single value from one or more values. 

#### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS :

#### STRING OPERATOR :
#### There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 

+ A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
+ Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
+ Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
+ Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
+ JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
+ Expressions evaluate into a single value.
+ Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

###### function functionName(parameters) { 
   // code to be executed}

   + second step you need to call the functiom if needed.

   + The function keyword goes first, then goes the name of the function, then a list of parameters between the parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function, also named “the function body”, between curly braces.
