# Understanding CSS: Thinking Inside the Box

### CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
##### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

### CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed
#### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

+ **CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.**

+ **Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).**

+ **Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.**

+ **Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.**

+ **CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.**

#### Background Color

+ Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
+ There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
+ Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
+ It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise  people will not be able to read your content).
+ CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
+  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
