# HTML

##### CONTENT LAYER
**. html files** 

##### This is where the content ofthe page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

# Javascript
##### PRESENTATION LAYER
**. js files**
##### This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

# CSS
##### BEHAVIOR LAYER
**.css files** 
##### The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.)


### CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT :
### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do notneed any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day. 

#### It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,because the script works with the model of the webpage that the browser has created.
