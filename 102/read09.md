# What is a text editor?

#### A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install onyour computer, or you access online through your web browser, thatallows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring **web developer**.

### What features should you look for in a text editor?
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting 
3. A variety of themes
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

## *code completion*:
##### allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

## *syntax highlighting*:
##### g is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.

## *A variety of themes*
##### These themes will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes.
